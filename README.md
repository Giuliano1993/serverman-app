# ServerMan App

In this new version of serverman you can manage your servers allo around by a friendly UserInterface

this is the Application version of my CLI tool [serverMan](https://github.com/Giuliano1993/serverMan).
This is a work in progress, still empty. 

CLI verstion actually manages Digital Ocean, Netlify and Vercel
In this version I intend to include AWS too.

Stay tuned for next updates.
